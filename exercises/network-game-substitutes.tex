\subsection{IE 5545 A Network Game of Substitutes}
In a game of substitutes a player has a \emph{decreasing} incentive to choose an action as
more neighbors choose the action. Suppose that there are only two actions for each player,
0 or 1. In the ``Best-shot'' public goods game, a player will receive a benefit
of 1 if she or any of her neighbors take action 1. For example, if you or any of your
neighbors buy a drill you will benefit (assuming your neighbors will lend you the drill)
but there is a cost for purchasing the drill so you prefer that one of your neighbors
buys the drill. In this game the utility to player $i$ is
\begin{align*}
  u_i(1,S_{N_i}) &= 1 - c\\
  u_i(0,S_{N_i}) &= \begin{cases}
    1 \quad \text{if $a_j=1$ for some $j \in N_i$}\\
    0 \quad \text{if $a_j=0$ for all $j \in N_i$}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where $N_i$ are the neighbors of player $i$, $S_{N_i}$ are the
strategies of the neighbors of player $i$, $a_j$ is the action taken
by player j, and $0 < c < 1$ is the cost for taking action 1.  Find a
pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the Best-shot public goods game
shown below that is different from the equilibrium given in class for
this game.
